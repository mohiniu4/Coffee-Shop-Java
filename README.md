# ☕ CoffeeShop Application

## 📌 Overview

The **CoffeeShop Application** is a Java-based console program that simulates a customizable coffee ordering system. It demonstrates the **Decorator Design Pattern** by allowing users to start with a base coffee (Americano, Cappuccino, Espresso) and dynamically add enhancements like Milk, Caramel, and Syrup, each affecting the final price and description.

This project is ideal for understanding:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
